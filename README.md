## Article about Blind SQL Injection

[Link to article](https://www.hackthis.co.uk/articles/blind-sql-injection)

This is an article about Blind SQL Injection and how to perform it. Essentially, Blind SQLi is a type of attack where the attacker can only figure out if their query to the database is true or false. As a result, it is a more time consuming type of attack where a brute force approach may work better by sending many queries and checking for a response to turn up positive in order to move forward with the attack. This is of particular interest to me as I am taking a class on offensive security, where I learn and practice these sorts of skills. While the course is interesting and fun, it is also rather challenging, so a resource like this has been useful for me as I had to automate a blind SQL injection using python as part of our weekly capture the flag assignment.
